# Developer test task. Number metamorphoses

You need to implement a method for transforming a string. The input string is presented as a number, which consists of digits from 1 to 7. The result should be presented as a string consisting of intervals of digits in ascending order, without duplicates. For instance:

```
("1234567" -> "1-7")
("7654321" -> "1-7")
("321567" -> "1-3, 5-7")
("1235" -> "1-3, 5")
("13476" -> "1, 3-4, 6-7")
("1236" -> "1-3, 6")
("612636" -> "1-3, 6")
```

The method must pass all tests. The main criterion is the optimality of the provided solution.
